# Nakli : Fake Data Generator for India

Nakli is a library for generating realistic but fake data specific to the Indian context. It started as a localization pack for Faker.js, a popular open-source fake data generation library.

## Why Nakli?

Relevant Data:  Nakli generates data that is relevant to the Indian context, including names, addresses, phone numbers, company names, and more. You won't have to settle for generic data that doesn't reflect Indian specificities.

MIT License:  The permissive MIT license allows you to easily contribute to Nakli's development and use it in your projects freely.

Pull Requests:  Feel free to submit pull requests with new features or bug fixes.  We have a welcoming community that will help you get started.

Spread the Word:  Talk about Nakli among your fellow Indian developers and help us grow the community!

## Roadmap

Nakli is under continuous development. Here's a glimpse of what's to come:

Expand Data Coverage: We're actively working on adding more Indian-specific data generation functionalities.

Enhance User Experience: We're committed to making Nakli user-friendly and well-documented.

Integrations: We're exploring integrations with popular Indian development tools and frameworks.

We believe Nakli can empower Indian developers to build better applications with realistic and relevant fake data. Join us in making Nakli the go-to solution for fake data generation in India!
